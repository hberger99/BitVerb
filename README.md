# BitVerb
Bit-Verb is a multi-effect plugin I created as a final project for the Audio Software Design II course at the University of Rochester. It was written in JUCE and contains modules for Reverb, Bit Crushing, and EQ. The cool thing about Bit-Verb is that you can use each of the modules individually as well as in combination with one another. This means that it can produce a wide range of sounds from a large concert hall to gritty distortion. This plugin was created from a combination of my own code and JUCE libraries.

The Source folder contains all of the JUCE code used in the creation of Bit-Verb. The Fonts and Images folders contain the Fonts and the Image used for the GUI. The .jucer file can be used to compile the plugin code using Xcode or Visual Studio. I have also included an instruction manual. 

Here are some links to demo videos:
